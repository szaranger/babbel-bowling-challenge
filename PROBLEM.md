BOWLING CHALLENGE

Idea
The idea is to implement a scoring system for a bowling game that should implement the following rules:
• A game consists of 10 frames.
• In general each frame has 2 rolls.
• In general a player scores the number of pins knocked down.
• If the player knocks down all 10 pins on the first roll it’s a strike. The player scores 10 plus the number of
pins knocked down in the next 2 rolls.
• If the player knocks down all 10 pins in two rolls it’s a spare. The player scores 10 plus the number of pins
knocked down in the next roll.
• Implement a decent implementation of the game - be creative here :).
Bonus
On top of the minimum requirements listed in the Idea section, consider the following bonus tasks:
• Add support for the last frame in the game. The player gets additional rolls in the last frame: on additional
roll for a spare after the second roll or two extra rolls for a strike.
• Support multiple players
• Unit tests
• Or anything fun you can think of ;)
Requirements / Constraints
• Use a repository on GitHub and use commits so we can follow your progress.
• The implementation should use ES2015 and preferably Angular (not mandatory)
• Do not exceed 2-3 hours to work on the challenge
• Add a Readme explaining how to run your app
Final remark
Keep in mind that we are more interested in how you approach this problem than completing all the features. If
you run out of time, please explain how you would proceed.
ENJOY!
